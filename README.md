Hi, I'm Ash!

✨ Just a girly hanging out the boys from IT ✨

I'm an IT student from Denmark studying datatech, with my specail being infrastructure. 

Other than that I collect retro consoles and I like to dabble with coding and scripting.
-- Side note, Most of the notes in my code will be in danish, since it's my native tongue.
